NetMap Readme
=============

Building the software
---------------------

* The current version requires the following:

	* g++ and GNU-make

        * some tools: traceroute, grep, awk

        * the Dotty program found in the Graphviz package, you can download it from
	  http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/download.html

The only thing you have to do is to run make from this directory and everything
should work. If not, don't hesitate to report problems.


Running NetMap
--------------

The current version of NetMap consists of two programs: makelist & netmap.

* makelist

  This program just executes traceroute for each host it finds in the
  hosts.txt. You should create your own file, but the default one will work as
  well. 

  It stores the output of the traceroutes in the ./netdata/ directory (or any
  directory you specify in config.h) where it is read by netmap.

  I am currently working on a version of netmap which incorporates this
  functionality, so makelist should disappear in the future.

* netmap 

  When run with no arguments, netmap reads the data from ./netdata/ and
  generates a netmap.dot file. Run netmap -h to get a list of all command line
  options. Note that netmap reads ./netdata/ recursively, so you can place the
  makelist output of different hosts in different sub-directories in
  ./netdata/. 

  You can then generate a graphical map of the network by running 
  "dotty netmap.dot" 

  For more details see netmap/README.

NetMap
======

Running NetMap
--------------

Usage: netmap [options]

  Netmap will (recursively) read the datadir containing the output of
  makelist. It will then create a list of all ip addresses and there
  interconnections. Unless the -n option is used, netmap will try to resolve
  the hostname of the address, but a cache is kept to speed up consecutive
  runs.

  Unless the -s option is used, netmap will insert an unknown host when a host
  did not respond on the traceroute. When 2 (or more) consecutive hosts in the
  route do not reply, they will be grouped in one node and the label will
  indicate the number of unknown hosts.

  Note that the datadir will be read recursively, this makes it possible to place
  the makelist output of different hosts in different subdirectories of netdata/.

  Options:

    -v	
	Be verbose

   -o <outfile.dot>
      
        Name for the dotty output file. The default is ./netmap.dot

   -d <datadir>

        Specify the datadir where the makelist output is located. 


        The
        default is ../netdata.

   -m <n> 

        Specify the maximum number of hops a node can be removed from the
        start. 0 gives no maximum, which is the default.

   -i 

        With this option netmap will create a directional dotty graph. This
        option gives a better result when drawing larger maps.

   -n
      
       Don't resolv hostnames. 

   -I <hostfile>

       With this option you can specify a list of ip-hostname pairs, eg for
       your local network. Lines in this file should start with the ip,
       followed by the hostname. Lines that don't start with a numeric value
       are ignored.
      
      Example:

	    #Local network
	    192.168.0.1		alpha
	    192.168.0.42	beta
	    192.168.30.5	gamma

	  
   -C <cachedipfile>

       Specify the file to use as local hostname cache. This file is read upon
       when netmap starts and written when it ends. It has the same format as
       the hostfile described for the -I option. The default value is
       ./netmap.hostcache.

   -F <failedipfile>

       Netmap keeps a cache of all ips it failed to resolv. The default value
       is ./netmap.failedip.

   -s 

       By default netmap inserts an unknown host when one host in the route did
       not reply on the traceroute, but the rest of the route is valid. When
       this option is used, netmap will stop reading when an invalid host is
       encountered in the traceroute output.

   -V 

       Print version and exit.


The output graph
================

The first node in a graph will be a parallelogram. For all other nodes, the
shape and the color depends on the number of links it has to other nodes

Legend:

	Number of links	   Shape	Color	
	2		   ellipse	cornsilk
	3		   box		lightsalmon
	4		   box		orange
	5		   box		orangered
	6		   box		crimson
	>= 7		   box		maroon

	Invalid host	   triangle	red

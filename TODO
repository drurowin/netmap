NetMap TODO
===========

These are the mayor changes I have in mind for NetMap, drop me note if you want
to help out with one of these:

   1. Integrate a parallel (and tcp based) traceroute in netmap

   2. Integerate the host-dectection of nmap in netmap

   3. Consider a MySQL interface where NetMap users can submit there
      results. With this we could try to make a complete map of the internet.

   4. Modify dotty to have NetMap specific menus...
